 In the OpenAI taxi environment, a taxi and a passenger are randomly postioned in a 5x5 grid. Goal of the taxi is to go to the passenger's location, pick the passenger and drop them of at the destination location.

The agent was trained using Deep-Q-Learning in about 13000 episodes with an average reward of above 8. 



# Here is a preview of the agnet playing the game:

# Train & Test

The agent can be trained by running the "train.py" file keep in mind that it takes some time for the model to train. The model can be tested by running the "test.py" file, it'll create and save a video of the agent playing the game.
